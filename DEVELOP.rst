Development Cheatsheet
======================

Git
===

Add Package Remote
------------------

It makes sense to directly supply a Github personal auth token when registering a new remote location for
the local repository, because that will remove any hassle with authentication when trying to push in the
future.

.. code-block:: shell

    git remote add origin https:://[github_username]:[github_token]@github.com/the16thpythonist/retayn.git
    git push origin master


Poetry
======

Setting up virtualenv development environment
---------------------------------------------

This project uses Poetry_ for package managment

First you need to create a new ``virtualenv`` in the root directory of the project. Then you need to
activate that environment and install Poetry_ into it.

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv ./
    ./venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install poetry

Then you can use ``poetry install`` to automatically install all the package dependencies listed within the
``pyproject.toml`` file.

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m poetry install
    python3 -m poetry env use ./venv/bin/python

**NOTE:** Whenever invoking any poetry command within the virtualenv it is
*necessary* to use the the format ``python -m poetry`` instead of just ``poetry`` because the latter will
always attempt to use the system python binary and not the venv binary!

.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/


Package Release on PyPI
-----------------------

The following steps in preparation of pushing a new release to github and PyPi. All references to the
version string will automatically be updated by the ``version`` command. Note that it is important to use
single quotes for the ``publish`` command.

.. code-block:: shell

    poetry lock
    poetry version [ major | minor | patch ]
    poetry build
    poetry publish --username='[pypi username]' --password='[pypi password]'
    git commit -a -m "commit message"
    git commit origin master


Sphinx
======

Create the documentation
------------------------

First you want to compile all of the docstrings with ``sphinx-autodoc`` and then build the html
documentation like this:

.. code-block:: shell

    sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source ./
    sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build
