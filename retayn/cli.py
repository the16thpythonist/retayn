    Custom implementation of click command group.

    You will probably not need this in most cases, but if you do it is good to have it. The main use case
    of having a custom class for this is for "lazy loading" commands. That means some commands to be created
    dynamically at runtime rather than statically in the code. The most common use case for that is
    probably plugin support for your application.
